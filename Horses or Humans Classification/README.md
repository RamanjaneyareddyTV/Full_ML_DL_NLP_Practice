# Horses or Humans Classification 

## GOAL
  The aim of this project is to create a model, able to classify the horses and humans. 
  
## DESCRIPTION 
  This project has done with Transfer Learning and implemented the three models, Exception, VGG16, Inception.
  In both the three models we have created a model and trained, also mapped and tested with the validation dataset. 
  By comparing the three models Inception has the best accuracy for classifing the humans or horses.

## DATASET
 The dataset is taken from the Kaggle. [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset)

## WHAT I HAD DONE
1. To import the required the modules.
2. Mounting the drive for easy access to the dataset.
3. Load the data from the drive.
4. Checking the images of horses and humans by visualizing it.
5. Preparing ths data for model creation.
6. Model Creation
   - Model 1 : Exception
        - Model Creation
        - Plotting
        - Testing
   - Model 2 : VGG 16
        - Model Creation
        - Plotting
        - Testing
   - Model 3 : Inception
        - Model Creation
        - Plotting
        - Testing
 

## MODELS USED 
  Here the model is based on the Transfer Learning using tensorflow and keras


## LIBRARIES NEEDED
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Os

## CONCLUSION
 By Inception Model we can achieve the maximum accuracy.
