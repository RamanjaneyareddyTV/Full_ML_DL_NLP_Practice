**Ice Cream Revenue Prediction**

**GOAL**<br>
The goal of this project is to predict the daily ice cream revenue form temperature feature.

**DATASET**<br>
Dataset can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vinicius150987/ice-cream-revenue).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- I trained over the dataset using Linear and Polynomial regression.
- Plotted the dataset and prediction curve.

**MODELS USED**
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**CONCLUSION**<br>
By using Linear regression I got 
 ```python
    r2_Score:  98.39%
 ``` 

 By using Polynomial regression I got 
 ```python
    r2_Score:  98.40%
 ```
