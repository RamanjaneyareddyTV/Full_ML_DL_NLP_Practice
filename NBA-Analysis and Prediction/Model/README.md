PROJECT TITLE : NBA EDA AND PREDICTION

GOAL : To predict number of points that were scored in the season 2013-2014 by the NBA players.

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the NBA dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used total 9 machine learning algos . In each algo I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset .

MODELS USED : I used total 11 machine leaning algos in the dataset

Logistic Regression : 64.13%

KNeighborsClassifier : 60.73%

SVC : 41.88%

Naive Bayes : 49.73%

DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER : 73.56%

RandomForestClassifier :  100.0%

AdaBoostClassifier : 34.29%

Gradient Boosting Classifier : 100.0%

XGBClassifier : 63.87%

ExtraTreesClassifier : 100.0%

Bagging Classifier : 99.21%

CONCLUSION : We get to know that most number of points were scored in the season 2013-2014 by the NBA players.

We get a training score of 100 % using the Random Forest Classifier and Extra Trees Classifier which is quite good.
