**Password Strength Classifier**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to classify and predict the strength of the password given in the dataset.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavikbb/password-strength-classifier-dataset).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data visualization
- Step 4: Data Training
- Step 5: Model Creation
- Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
-  Linear Regression
-  Ridge Regression
-  Decision Tree Regressor


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- warnings
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  82.00
 ``` 
- By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  43.77
 ``` 
 - By using Decision Tree Regressor model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.96
 ``` 

* Decision tree regressor is more efficient model.
