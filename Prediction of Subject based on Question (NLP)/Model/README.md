**Conclusion**

In this project we have first processed the text data using the NLP techniques and then tried to visualize the most relavent words using various WordClouds. Once the preprocessing and the visualization is done we saved the processed text data, converted it into feature vectors to perform a comparative model analysis using different classifier models. After doing the result is that the Random Forest Classifier performs better than other models with a Training Accuracy of 98% and a testing accuracy of 87%. So we have saved this model and its predictions also.
