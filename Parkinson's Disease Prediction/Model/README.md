**Project Title**

Parkinson's Disease Prediction


**GOAL**

Try finding the reasons for Parkinsons disease and predict who might have it next!


**WHAT I HAD DONE**

- With the help of EDA and machine learning algorithm to find out the reasons for Parkinsons disease and predict who might have it next.
- My conclusion is that the logistic regression and KNN is the best models for prediction.
- That in EDA I clean the data and use visualization techniques to find  out useful insights. 
- Hence the model built successfully and is ready to predict the Parkinson's disease who get next.


**MODELS USED**

-  Linear Regression
-  K-Nearest Neighbors
-  Random Forest Regressor
-  Decision Tree Regressor

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- Sklearn

**CONCLUSION**

By using Linear Regression I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:   85.0%
 ``` 

 By using K-nearest neighbors I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:   94.0%
 ``` 
By using Random Forest Regressor I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:   94.0%
 ``` 
By using Decision Tree Regressor I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:   91.0%
 ```
