### WHAT I HAD DONE Listed down the step by step procedure of how project works using points.
- Importing the required modules
- Loading the dataset using pandas module
- Analysing and cleaning the dataset
- Using matplotlib visualising the data.
- Using seaborn to visualize pictographically.
- Using seaborn to see the aspect, elevation and slope of the forest range.
- Generated the Heatmap.
- Design a modelusing classification
- Predicted the result using the dataset.


### MODELS USED 
   The RandomForest Classifier model is used and easily implemented to gives better classification result.  


### LIBRARIES NEEDED Add all the libraries needed in this project
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn


### CONCLUSION 
  Random score is 0.9431.
