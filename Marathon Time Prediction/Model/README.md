**Marathon Time Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to predict the time for the marathon using the given details in dataset.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/girardi69/marathon-time-predictions).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data visualization
- Step 4: Data Training
- Step 5: Model Creation
- Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression



**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- warnings
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
 - By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  94.04
 ``` 
- By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  86.42
 ``` 
 - By using K Neighbors Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  86.42
 ``` 

**Conclusion:**
- Accuracy of Regression models- Lasso regression, rigde regression is same.

- Whereas accuracy of Linear Regression is higher and root mean square error is least.

- Linear Regression is more efficient model.
