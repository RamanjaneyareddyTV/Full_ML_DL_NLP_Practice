# Rain Prediction

## GOAL

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict on the basis of some given Features.

## Dataset

You can download dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package?select=weatherAUS.csv)

## What I had Done

* Firstly we Clear the data and handled the missing Values:

![After](https://github.com/Isha307/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/Rain%20Prediction/Images/Change%20Values.png)

* I did some feature scaling and feature Engineering.

* Checked the accuracy using different classification algorithm.

* Created Model using Random Forest.
