To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customer's segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.

**GOAL:**
This model will predict the eligibility of a customer for getting a loan from the company.

**MODELS USED:**
I have used the Logistic Regression algorithm for model building. 

**WHAT I HAD DONE:**
I have done the following operations on the given dataset.
- Data Exploration
- Data Cleaning
