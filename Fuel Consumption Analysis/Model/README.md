# Car Fuel Consumption

## Goal

Predict the consumption depending on the gas type.

They can be used to determine the effect of weather, speed or gas type on the car consumption.

## Dataset

You can download dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/anderas/car-consume)

# Dataset have following features:

* distance - Distance to travel

* consume - fuel consumed

* speed - speed of the car

* temp_inside - inside temp of car

* temp_outside - outside temp of car

* specials - Rain/Sun/half sun half rain/snow

* gas_type - SP98 or E10

* AC - AC on or not

* rain - rain or not

* sun - sun or not

## What I had done

* Importing Libraries

* Loading Dataset

* Data Preprocessing

* Checking for missing values and filling it

* Compiling Model

## MODELS USED 

"Linear Regression"

"KNN"
    
"SVM" 

"Naive Bayes"

"Decisiontree"

"RandomForest"

"LogisticRegression" 

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

* pandas

* numpy

* matplotlib

* seaborn

* sklearn

## CONCLUSION 

I tried different algorithm to predict the accuaracy, Logistic Regression worked best for it.
