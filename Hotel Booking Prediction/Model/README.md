PROJECT TITLE : Hotel Booking Prediction

GOAL : To predict the possibility of the booking ,whether the booking is successfull or not .

DATASET : https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the hotel booking dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used total 9 machine learning algos . In each algo I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset .

MODELS USED : I used total 9 machine leaning algos in the dataset

Logistic Regression
KNeighborsClassifier
DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER
Random Forest Classifier
AdaBoostClassifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
XGBClassifier
ExtraTreesClassifier
Bagging Classifier
LIBRARIES NEEDED :
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scipy
Sklearn

CONCLUSION : I got a accuracy score of 97 % using the Random Forest Classifier and get to know that the booking is succesful.
