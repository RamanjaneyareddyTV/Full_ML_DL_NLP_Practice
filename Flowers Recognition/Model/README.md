### Acess at : https://flower-identification.herokuapp.com/

### Goal
The goal of this project is to identify the flower name from an image uploaded by the user.

### Dataset 
Used the dataset at : https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition

## Steps:
- Split the images into train,test and Validation.
- Used an Image Data generator to perform some processing on the images and get them ready for training.
- Used transfer learning to build the model.
- Trained the models
- Tested the models
- Finally , Deployed the model using flask and Heroku.
- Predictions.

### I used Transfer learning.

### Libraries used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Keras,Tensorflow
- Scikit-Learn
- Flask
- Gunicorn
- OS

### Results
I got the best accuracy of ~93% .
