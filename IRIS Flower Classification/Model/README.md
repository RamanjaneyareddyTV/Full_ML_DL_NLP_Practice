# IRIS Flower Classification

### About the project:
- The project is a clasical machine learning problem
- The project aims towards classifying the flowers under 3 different types : Iris-versicolor, Iris-setosa and Iris-virginica
- We use one of the most popular classification type data set: [IRIS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)

### How to run:
- Driect to the Models Folder and navigate to [IRIS Flower Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/Sidhved/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/IRIS%20Flower%20Classification/Model/iris_flower_classification.ipynb)
- Follow the directions present in the markdown cells and run the notebook accordingly

### Results and Future Advancements
- Looking at the ideal situation the data set provides, a low bias model like Gaussian Naive Bayes was able to prdict every species perfectly.
- Use different means of accuracy calculation like the GridSearch, Confusion Matrix, Gini Index, etc.
- Use more versatile feature selection techniques based on correlation values for dominant results.
