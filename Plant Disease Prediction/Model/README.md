### Goal of this project is to identify the condition of a plant by looking at the image provided.

I have used transfer learning technique to train the model and have used Mobilenet model to keep the process efficient.

### Steps followed 
- Read,process and organize dataset.
- Look at some of the given data.
- Fetch the pre-trained model and transfer it to local model.
- Train and test.
- Make predictions and visualize results.
