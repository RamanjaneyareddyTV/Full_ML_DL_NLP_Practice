**Organ Donors Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to predict donors using the information contained in this dataset.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/momohmustapha/donorsprediction).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data visualization
- Step 4: Data Training
- Step 5: Model Creation
- Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K Neighbors Classifier
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- warnings
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Logistic Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  74.52
 ``` 
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  03.81
 ``` 
- By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  03.81
 ``` 
- By using K Neighbors Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  74.56
 ``` 
- By using Lasso Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  00.44
 ``` 
- By using Random Forest Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  76.11
 ``` 
- By using Decision Tree Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  63.04
 ``` 
 - By using XGBoost Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  73.71
 ``` 
**Conclusion:**
- Accuracy of Regression models- Linear regression, rigde regression, Lasso Regression is very low.

- Whereas accuracy of Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier is almost same.

- And the Accuracy of the Random Forest is more, so it is efficient among all.
