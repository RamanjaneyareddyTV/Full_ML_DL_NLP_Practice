    "## Classification Algorithms\n",
    "Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.”\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of classification tasks that you may encounter in machine learning and specialized approaches to modeling that may be used for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I am going to use 10 Classification algorithms, based on these the models will be trained and then evaluated using the accuracy scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following models that we are going to use -**\n",
    "  * **Logistic Regression** : Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Decision Tree Classifier** : Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Random Forest Classifier** : Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Gausian NB** : This method is expected to be called several times consecutively on different chunks of a dataset so as to implement out-of-core or online learning. This is especially useful when the whole dataset is too big to fit in memory at once. This method has some performance and numerical stability overhead, hence it is better to call partial_fit on chunks of data that are as large as possible (as long as fitting in the memory budget) to hide the overhead.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **KNN algorithm** : K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique. K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories. K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Support Vector Machine Algorithm** : Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning. The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier** : Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple yet efficient optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters/coefficients of functions that minimize a cost function. In other words, it is used for discriminative learning of linear classifiers under convex loss functions such as SVM and Logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** : Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction technique. As the name implies dimensionality reduction techniques reduce the number of dimensions (i.e. variables) in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible.\n",
