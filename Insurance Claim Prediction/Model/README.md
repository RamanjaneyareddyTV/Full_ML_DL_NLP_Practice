**Insurance Claim Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to classify insurance claim as 0 or 1 (if the policy holder will claim insurance or not) from features as age, number of children, BMI, residential region  etc.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/easonlai/sample-insurance-claim-prediction-dataset).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Visualization
- Step 3: Data Training
- Step 4: Model Creation
- Step 5: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
-  Logistic Regression
-  Decision Tree Classifier
-  Naive Bayes
-  KNN
-  Random Forest Classifier



**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Logistic Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  79.07
 ``` 
 - By using Decision Tree Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  1.00
 ``` 
 - By using Naive Bayes model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  78.22
 ``` 
  - By using KNN  model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  68.22
 ``` 
  - By using Random Forest Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  1.00
 ```
* After performance evaluation of classification algorithms used in this project, we can conclude that decision tree classifier and random forest classifier works best as compared to logistic regression, naive bayes and KNN.
